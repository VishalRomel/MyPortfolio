    <h1>About Java</h1>
    <p>
        Java, developed by Sun Microsystems in 1995, is a versatile, object-oriented programming language widely used for various applications including web development, mobile applications, and enterprise software. Its platform independence, achieved through the use of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), allows code to run on any device that supports Java, making it a popular choice for cross-platform development. With a syntax similar to C++, Java is designed to be easy to learn and use, while providing powerful features for building robust, high-performance applications.
